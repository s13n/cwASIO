; Module-definition file for a cwASIOdriver DLL for Windows.
; The DLL implements a COM class factory, so we just need to export the functions required by COM.
; This includes functions for registering and deregistering the COM class in the Windows registry.
; We can't use declspec(dllexport) for those because the naming convention doesn't match (leading "@")
